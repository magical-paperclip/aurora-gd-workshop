## core game development concepts:
- **character physics**: how to make a character move and jump realistically
- **collision detection**: how objects interact with each other in the game world
- **state management**: keeping track of player progress through checkpoints
- **event handling**: responding to player actions and game events
- **scene architecture**: organizing ur game into manageable components




## features
- **smooth player movement**: left/right movement with jumping mechanics using godots built-in characterbody2d
- **checkpoint system**: automatically saves progress when reaching checkpoint areas, allowing players to respawn at safe locations
- **death zones**: hazardous areas that reset player to last checkpoint, adding challenge and consequence
- **physics-based movement**: realistic gravity, ground detection, and collision handling
- **tilemap support**: build complex levels using godot's tilemap system with automatic collsion detection
- **camera following**: camera automatically tracks player movement for smooth gameplay experience




## how the scripts work together

**the game architecture**

the game uses a **manager pattern** where different components communicate through a central checkpoint manager:

1. **checkpointmanager.gd** acts as the "brain" - it remembers where the player should respawn
2. **checkpoint.gd** tells the manager "player reached a safe spot here"
3. **death.gd** tells the manager "player died, send them back to safety"
4. **player.gd** handles all the movement and physics independently

### script explanations

#### player.gd - character movement system

**what it does:**
- applies gravity so player falls when not on ground
- detects arrow key input for left/right movement  
- handles jumping with spacebar (only when touching ground)
- uses `move_and_slide()` to handle collision with walls and floors
- smooth acceleration and deceleration for natural-feeling movement

**key concepts:**
- `velocity`: player's current speed and direction
- `is_on_floor()`: checks if player is standing on solid ground
- `delta`: time between frames, ensures consistent movement speed

#### checkpointmanager.gd - save system

**what it does:**
- stores the player's last safe location in `last_location`
- provides `update_checkpoint()` function for checkpoints to call
- provides `respawn_player()` function for death zones to call
- finds and remembers reference to player node for easy access

**why it's separate:**
- keeps save/load logic in one place
- allows multiple checkpoints and death zones to share the same system
- makes it easy to add features like multiple lives or score tracking

#### checkpoint.gd - progress saving

**how it works:**
1. uses `area2d` with collision detection to sense when player enters
2. `body_entered` signal automatically triggers when something enters the area
3. checks if the entering object is named "Player" (ignores other objects)
4. gets position from `respawnpoint` marker (exact spot to respawn)
5. calls `checkpoint_manager.update_checkpoint()` to save the location

**the respawnpoint marker:**
- `marker2d` node that shows exactly where player will appear
- separate from collision area so you can fine-tune spawn position
- visible in editor but invisible in game

#### death.gd - hazard system

**the death sequence:**
1. detects player entering death zone using `area2d` collision
2. calls `kill_player()` function to handle death
3. brief delay using `await` for dramatic effect
4. calls `checkpoint_manager.respawn_player()` to teleport player to safety
5. resets player velocity to prevent weird physics behavior





## scene setup explained

### main scene setup

# main scenes setup

```
main (Node2D)          # root node - container for everything
├── checkpointmanager (Node2D)      # manages respawn system
├── player (CharacterBody2D)        # player character with physics
│   ├── sprite2d (Sprite2D)         # visual representation of player
│   ├── collisionshape2d (CollisionShape2D) # defines player's collision box
│   └── camera2d (Camera2D)         # follows player around the level
├── tilemaplayer (TileMap)          # level geometry and platforms
├── checkpoint (Area2D)             # safe zone that updates spawn point
│   ├── collisionshape2d (CollisionShape2D) # detection area for checkpoint
│   └── respawnpoint (Marker2D)     # exact location for respawning
└── death (Area2D)                  # hazardous zone that kills player
    └── collisionshape2d (CollisionShape2D) # danger area that triggers death
```



### why this structure works

**node hierarchy importance:**
- parent-child relationships determine how objects move together
- `camera2d` as child of player makes camera follow automatically
- `respawnpoint` as child of checkpoint moves with checkpoint
- proper hierarchy makes node paths predictable for scripts

**separation of concerns:**
- each node has one specific job
- player handles movement, checkpoints handle saving, deaths handle killing
- makes debugging easier and code more maintainable





## required input actions setup

godot uses an "input map" to translate keyboard presses into game actions:

### setting up controls
1. go to **project → project settings → input map**
2. make sure these actions exist (create if missing):
   - `ui_left` → left arrow key
   - `ui_right` → right arrow key  
   - `ui_accept` → spacebar

### why use input actions instead of direct key detection
- allows players to customize controls later
- works with gamepads automatically
- makes code more readable (`ui_left` vs `KEY_LEFT`)
- supports multiple keys for same action





## customization guide

### adjusting player movement feel
in `Player.gd`, modify these constants:
- `SPEED = 300.0` → horizontal movement speed (higher = faster)
- `JUMP_VELOCITY = -400.0` → jump strength (more negative = higher jumps)
- gravity is pulled from project settings automatically

### adding new checkpoints
1. in main scene, instance the `checkpoint.tscn` scene
2. position the checkpoint where you want the safe zone
3. move the `respawnpoint` marker to exact spawn location
4. resize collision shape to cover desired activation area
5. test by running game and walking through checkpoint

### creating death zones  
1. instance the `death.tscn` scene in your main scene
2. position over dangerous areas (pits, spikes, enemies)
3. scale collision shape to cover entire hazardous area
4. test to ensure proper detection without false positives

### building levels with tilemaps
1. select the `tilemaplayer` node in your main scene
2. make sure tileset resource is loaded with proper collision shapes
3. use paint tool to draw platforms and walls
4. test collision by running game and walking into tiles
5. place checkpoints at reasonable intervals (after difficult sections)
6. add death zones under pits or near obstacles




## troubleshooting common issues

### player falls through tiles
- **cause**: tileset doesn't have collision shapes enabled
- **fix**: in tileset editor, select tiles and press "f" to add collision shapes
- **check**: collision shapes should appear red in tileset editor

### checkpoints not working
- **cause**: incorrect node naming or paths
- **fix**: ensure player node is named exactly "Player" (capital P matters)
- **check**: node paths in scripts match your scene structure

### camera not following player  
- **cause**: camera2d not child of player, or not enabled
- **fix**: make camera2d a direct child of player node
- **check**: camera2d "enabled" checkbox is checked in inspector

### player can double/triple jump
- **cause**: `is_on_floor()` detection not working properly
- **fix**: check collision shape covers player sprite properly
- **check**: player collision shape isn't too small or offset

### death zones not triggering
- **cause**: collision shapes not overlapping properly
- **fix**: make death zone collision shapes larger than visual area
- **check**: area2d monitoring is enabled in inspector




## expanding your game

- **animated sprites**: replace static sprites with animated versions
- **sound effects**: add audio for jumping, checkpoints, deaths
- **particle effects**: add visual flair for checkpoints and deaths
